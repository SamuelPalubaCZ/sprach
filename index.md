# Sprach Machine - Number Station Simulator

A web-based application that simulates a number station. It can convert a message of numbers into a sequence of spoken digits, and generate a downloadable audio file of the message.

This is a complete rebuild of the original "Stasi Morse-Speech Generator" experiment, with a modern design and new features based on user feedback.

## Features

*   **Speech Audio Generation**: Enter a call sign and a message body of numbers. The application will generate a single `.wav` audio file of the message being spoken.
*   **Audio Playback and Download**: The generated audio file can be played directly on the page or downloaded for later use.
*   **Text Encryption Tool**: A built-in cipher tool allows you to encrypt and decrypt messages using a simple XOR cipher.
*   **Streamlined Workflow**: The "Encrypt" button automatically copies the resulting ciphertext into the main message body, ready for audio generation.
*   **Manual Tones**: You can play individual number and word sounds using the keypad buttons.
*   **Modern UI**: The application has a clean, simple, and responsive user interface.

## Credits

*   Original concept and code by **tom|hetmer|cz**.
*   Rebuilt and redesigned by **SamuelPalubaCZ**.
