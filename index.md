# Stasi Speech Machine

A comprehensive number station simulator and audio generation toolkit for educational and research purposes.

## Professional Number Station Simulator

This application provides authentic tools for converting text and numerical sequences into synthesized audio broadcasts, mimicking the functionality of historical number stations used during the Cold War era.

This is a modern reconstruction of the original "Stasi Morse-Speech Generator" with updated functionality, improved user interface, and enhanced security features.

## Core Features

### üéØ Audio Transmitter
- Professional speech synthesis for numerical sequences
- High-quality German-accented voice generation
- Station identification and call sign support
- Immediate playback and WAV download capabilities
- Authentic number station broadcast simulation

### üîê Cipher Operations
- Advanced XOR encryption and decryption
- Custom encryption key support
- Character-to-numeric code conversion
- Integrated workflow: plaintext ‚Üí encrypted ‚Üí audio
- Secure message encoding for transmission

### üéµ Manual Tone Generator
- Individual digit tone generation (0-9)
- Special operational signals:
  - **Achtung** (Attention Signal)
  - **Trennung** (Separation Tone) 
  - **Ende** (End Transmission)
- Real-time audio testing and verification
- Professional keypad interface

## Quick Start Guide

### üöÄ Audio Transmission
1. Navigate to **Transmitter** section
